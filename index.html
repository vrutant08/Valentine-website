          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="line">You know that today, the world is wrapped in shades of roses 🌹 and chocolates 🍫</span><br>
            <span class="line">but for me it's not only about roses 🌹 or chocolates 🍫.</span><br>
            <span class="line">It's about this moment, writing you, pouring out every corner of my heart</span><br>
            <span class="line">and reminding you that you've been the most vibrant color in my life.</span>

            <span class="line">Being with you and proposing you was the best decision I’ve ever made in my life,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I’m sorry I have said I don’t like being with you many times when I was angry at you,</span><br>
            <span class="line">but I never felt, I never ever had a thought passing my mind that, “I should not have been with you”</span><br>
            <span class="line">ever since I met you, everything started making more sense,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I found myself and my soul resonating with you,</span><br>
            <span class="line">and I started doing the things and being more intrigued with them which resonated with my soul.</span><br>
            <span class="line">You make me feel, some of the feelings I didn’t even realize I was capable of having.</span><br>
            <span class="line">Some of them are foreign to me, so I take little bit more time to recognize them.</span><br>
            <span class="line">Each time I talk to you I feel my words flow by themselves; I don’t need to think about them,</span><br>
            <span class="line">my mind, my body feels free with you.</span><br>
            <span class="line">When I think about how you look at me, how our fingers fit together,</span><br>
            <span class="line">how you feel in my arms, your lips 💋 against mine everything feels just so right.</span><br>
            <span class="line">You must be thinking why I’m saying this when I haven’t even felt how half of them feels,</span><br>
            <span class="line">but before you I only thought that I would have them with my life partner,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I met you in long distance but you still made me feel these feelings with your immense intimacy.</span><br>
            <span class="line">My heart ❤️ recognizes yours, and I swear it beats differently when I’m with you.</span>

          <p>
            <span class="line">I know recently you told me, “I don’t know if you miss me the way I miss you”</span><br>
            <span class="line">I haven’t wrote things this way because I was invested in many other things that kept my mind busy.</span><br>
            <span class="line">But for the answer of your worry I will say, when I miss you, you're all around me,</span><br>
            <span class="line">with me, in me, and alongside me… yet still so far away.</span><br>
            <span class="line">I see you in the waters of the lake, and I drown in your love as it washes over me,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I see you in the sun rays coming through the clouds.</span><br>
            <span class="line">This is still not enough to say how much I think about you and how much I want you by my side.</span><br>
            <span class="line">I’m able to imagine the next 60 years of my life, amidst the hustle of life, you are always with me.</span><br>
            <span class="line">I hear your encouraging words, I can feel the familiarity of our souls, and I know that I’m home.</span><br>
            <span class="line">You provide me with the sense of peace and acceptance.</span><br>
            <span class="line">But when I think about all the love and warmth you’ve poured into my life,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I can’t help but feel that I’ve been holding the world’s most precious gift in my hands.</span><br>
            <span class="line">And like what kind of love would it be if I didn’t want to give you that same peace?</span><br>
            <span class="line">I want to be your strength, your light, your peace just as you’ve been mine.</span><br>
            <span class="line">I see the cracks I’ve left behind in you, the ones I wish I could have filled with love instead of pain,</span><br>
            <span class="line">I can’t erase the past but as I’ve given you a promise, I want to spend the rest of my life making sure your heart feels full.</span>

            <span class="line">My Giasemi, I can’t stop the flow of my tears when I’m writing this letter to you,</span><br>
            <span class="line">but really, all of these feelings that I have described above, I never thought I would feel them for someone…</span><br>
            <span class="line">Thank you for giving me power, for giving me an opportunity to feel this way, and for giving me a great life,</span><br>
            <span class="line">thank you for being my valentine.</span><br>
            <span class="line">I want to keep on embracing our relationship with you</span><br>
            <span class="line">and make even more loving memories that we will cherish in our hearts forever.</span>
