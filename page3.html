I’m not away for long, my darling. The time will fly, and soon, I’ll be there to pull you into my arms. I’ll listen to everything you’ve been holding onto, every little thought or worry, and together, we’ll let it all out.
Until then, whenever you miss me, just close your eyes and feel my presence. Feel my hand in yours, and my voice reminding you how much I adore you. You are my everything, and no distance can ever change that.

Right now, as you’re reading these words, let the thought of me be your refuge. Imagine my arms wrapped around you, holding you close, shielding you from all the heaviness of the world. You’re not alone, my love, not for a single moment.

Take a moment to pause, my darling, and breathe with me. You are so much stronger than this hard day, and I’ll remind you of that again and again if I have to. Remember how many storms you’ve already surpassed? This one is no match for your resilience.
I love you more than words can ever say, and I’m so proud of you for facing today, even if it feels like the world is against you.

Even while I’m away, my heart stays with you. You’re the only one who has ever occupied it this completely, this deeply. I’m always thinking of you, picturing your beautiful smile, and wishing I could wrap you in my arms right this moment.
I’ll reach out to you soon, I promise. But until then, don’t let your heart be deceived by the whispers of overthinking or doubt. My devotion to you is unshaken, my love.

Oh no, it seems like Prince Hanu hasn’t showered you with enough compliments today, huh? *cough cough* Don’t worry, I’ll speak for him. If he were here right now, I know exactly what he’d say to ease your heart and make you feel like the queen you are.
You are the kind of woman who walks into someone’s life and changes it forever. You didn’t just enter my life you took up permanent residence in every corner of my heart, filling it with love, light, and a beauty that can’t be measured. I wont compare your beauty with any goddess and tell you that you look like her, because you by yourself are a goddess of beauty, you redefine the measures of being beautiful. 
You are a masterpiece in every sense of the word, my princess. There’s no one like you, and there never will be. So today, I want you to feel as special as you truly are unique, irreplaceable, and endlessly loved. Hold your head high, my love, because the world is better just by having you in it. And don’t you ever forget that.

Maybe we had a fight, and I might have behaved in a way that hurt you. But hey, listen to me, okay? You know, deep down, that it wasn’t really me speaking it was just a fleeting moment of frustration or misunderstanding. You know the real me, the one who treasures you beyond words and holds you as the most precious part of my life.
Think back to those late nights when it was just us, You know what we have told each other at late nights, when we are so affectionate, when we are lost in each other’s lust driven by our fantasies and hearts, when we are being so truthful, You need to know we are fighting this because we are waiting for something so great. We’re building something extraordinary together, and it’s not easy because nothing this beautiful and rare ever is. But you need to know that every bump, every disagreement, and every tear is just a step toward something so much greater. We’re fighting for the kind of love that stands the test of time, the kind that people dream about but rarely get to live.
